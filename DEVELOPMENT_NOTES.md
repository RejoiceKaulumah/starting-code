## Challenges Faced

During development, I found the following parts particularly difficult:  

1. **Accordion functionality**  
   - Ensuring only one section is open at a time and icons update correctly.  

2. **Cards & responsive layouts**  
   - Making cards flexible and visually appealing across different screen sizes.  

3. **Responsiveness overall**  
   - Adjusting elements like sliders, modals, and calendars to fit small and large screens.

## Lessons Learned

- Manipulating DOM elements dynamically requires careful planning for event listeners.  
- Modular JavaScript functions make interactive components easier to manage.  
- Toast notifications greatly improve user feedback and interaction clarity.  
- Mobile support (touch gestures) is essential for modern web applications.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with **interactive UI components**, responsive design, and user experience enhancements using vanilla JavaScript. Despite the challenges, I gained a deeper understanding of **DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS customization**.
